---  An external table is a table for which Hive does not manage storage. If you delete an external table, only the definition in Hive is deleted. 
     The data remains.
     An internal table is a table that Hive manages.
     
     When a user creates a table in Hive specifying the external keyword, then an external table is created. 
     The data present in the external table will be fully managed by HDFS contrary to an internal table.
     
     When a user creates a table in Hive it is by default an internal table created in the /user/hive/warehouse directory in HDFS which is its default storage location.
     The data present in the internal table will be stored in this directory and is fully managed by Hive and thus an internal table is also referred to as a managed 
     table.
