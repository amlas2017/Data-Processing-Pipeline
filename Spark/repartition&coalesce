--- Change the number of partitions on a DataFrame:
   
   Repartition (function) :
        Increase or decrease partitions.
        Repartition always involves a shuffle.
        Repartition works by creating new partitions and doing a full shuffle to move data around.
        Results in more or less equal sized partitions.
        Since a full shuffle takes place, repartition is less performant than coalesce.
        
   Coalesce
        Only decrease the number of partitions.
        Coalesce doesnâ€™t involve a full shuffle.
        If the number of partitions is reduced from 5 to 2. Coalesce will not move data in 2 executors and move the data from the remaining 3 executors to the 2 executors. Thereby avoiding a full shuffle.
        Because of the above reason the partition size vary by a high degree.
        Since full shuffle is avoided, coalesce is more performant than repartition.
